The Weather Radio Mod adds various different kind of weather and AM/FM radios into Minecraft for your decorating needs!

This mod is currently only available for 1.18.2, however moving to future versions is planned.

Currently the weather radios are not functional and serve as decoration purposes only, however the ability to play Icecast streams and other forms of audio maybe added in future versions.

**For some reason Curseforge disallows mods with the word "Mod" in the name, and for this reason it is called "T3chyy's Weather Radios".**
